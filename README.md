# Introduction to Python Scrapy

Scrapy is a powerful web crawling and scraping framework written in Python. It allows you to efficiently extract data from websites and store it in a structured format such as JSON, CSV, or XML.

## Getting Started

1. Install Scrapy using pip:
    ```
    pip install scrapy
    ```

2. Create a new Scrapy project:
    ```
    scrapy startproject myproject
    ```

3. Define your spider to crawl websites and extract data:
    ```python
    import scrapy

    class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
        name = 'myspider'
        start_urls = ['http://example.com']

        def parse(self, response):
            # Extract data here
            pass
    ```

4. Run your spider:
    ```
    scrapy crawl myspider
    ```

## Features

- Easy-to-use API for web scraping
